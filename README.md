## Instructions

The Memory Game Project is all about demonstrating my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills so far (03.04.2018), as the third project of Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.

The repository for the starter code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game).
